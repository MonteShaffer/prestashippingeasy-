Module for ShippingEasy to Work with PrestaShop 1.6.1

For some reason unknown to the world, the "open source" platform known as "addons.prestashop.com" disappeared this free shipping module.  Maybe because they wanted to make the almighty $$$ selling their paid-for-services.  For the open-source community, this is just UNCOOL.

After chatting with the "addons" people, I was told to ask ShippingEasy, so I did.

They told me to contact "addons" and so I was in the dreaded "support loop."

Finally, a breakthrough, I got the zip file...

Hi Monte,

Thanks for your patience while we looked into this further.

Our partnership team is working with PrestaShop to get our plugin re-added to their module page. 
I spoke to my Product Manager, and in the meantime you can download our app manually using this .zip file (attached).

It's also worth mentioning that when you add the module manually the steps are little different to our current 
Knowledge Base article (linked below). On Step 3 in the article you will need to go to "Add a new module" 
in the top right of that page (image attached). You will then be prompted to upload the .zip file that is attached. 
Once you upload this file the following warning will be displayed (image(1) attached) and you will need to select 
"Proceed with the installation". The next actions will then match those in Step 6 through 18 in the article.

Here is the step by step on how to integrate PrestaShop

Warm regards,
```
